    <p>They take my kindness for...WEAKNESS They take my silence for...SPEECHLESS ...They consider my uniqueness...STRANGE<br> 
    They call my language...SLANG They see my confidence as...CONCEIT <br>

They see my mistakes as...DEFEAT <br>

They consider my success...ACCIDENTAL <br>

They minimize my intelligence to...POTENTIAL <br>

My questions mean I am...UNAWARE <br>

My advancement is somehow...UNFAIR <br>

To voice concern is...DISCONTENTMENT

If I stand up for myself I am too...DEFENSIVE <br>

If I don't trust them I am too...APPREHENSIVE <br>

I am defiant if I...SEPARATE <br>

  <p>My Mother said I could be anything I want to be.<br> 
 And its up to me to turn my daydreams into realities <br>
And typically,I just go with the flow as I paddle streams <br>
But now my passion burns like calories for my purpose in this thing called life<br>
What position do I play?<br>
I'm on a mission every day to decipher what kinda life <br>
I should lead.<br>
Should I lead? Should I follow. <br>
Am I filled or am I hallow? <br>
I need water cuz this life has been a tough pill to swallow. <br>
Although that begs the question, Who am I?<br>
No seriously who am I?<br>
I haven't come to a conclusion<br>
I need answers<br>
But all I have is options. <br>
And my heart is always shopping for new identities that need adopting.<br> 
Cuz I've been the outcast. I've been the jock. <br>
I've been the straight shooter. I've run from cops. <br>
I feel like an actor but in this scene they took away the props<br>
I have nothing to hide behind<br>
And here I stand, exposed. <br>
Like tan lines <br>
      Left with the question, who am I?<br></p>

      The depth of a father's love shows in his daughter's eyes.<br>

What's known is what's shown from sunset to sunrise.<br>

A foundation built on more than just what is spoken.<br>

It's commitments kept and promises that go unbroken.<br>

An emotion so immense that nothing in this world can erase.<br>

The permanent impression of love is tattooed upon her face.<br>

A relation so peculiar that only the two can understand,<br>

Yet so immaculate it's obvious that, by God, it was planned.<br>
          
I believe it all began when she would sleep upon your chest.<br>

Now you're her number one, her favorite, you're the best!<br>

You move and she watches so closely it's as if she's in a trance.<br>

The fact that she can repeat you, exactly, isn't just by chance.<br>

From wrestling, racing, jump roping to being made up like a doll.<br>

Both playmate and best friend, you've done some of it all.<br>

A secret place, a look, special time just for her and you.<br>

When a choice is to be made, it's all about what Daddy wants to do.<br>

And
