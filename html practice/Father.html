    <h1>A Fathers Love</h1>

  <section id="section-c">
    <p>The depth of a father's love shows in his daughter's eyes.<br>

What's known is what's shown from sunset to sunrise.<br>

A foundation built on more than just what is spoken.<br>

It's commitments kept and promises that go unbroken.<br>

An emotion so immense that nothing in this world can erase.<br>

The permanent impression of love is tattooed upon her face.<br>

A relation so peculiar that only the two can understand,<br>

Yet so immaculate it's obvious that, by God, it was planned.<br><br>



I believe it all began when she would sleep upon your chest.<br>

Now you're her number one, her favorite, you're the best!<br>

You move and she watches so closely it's as if she's in a trance.<br>

The fact that she can repeat you, exactly, isn't just by chance.<br>

From wrestling, racing, jump roping to being made up like a doll.<br>

Both playmate and best friend, you've done some of it all.<br>

A secret place, a look, special time just for her and you.<br>

When a choice is to be made, it's all about what Daddy wants to do.<br>

And you're there to cater to her every need and every wish.<br>

There's an invisible pedestal for Daddy's little princess.<br>

She's content just to be. She's filled with absolute bliss<br>
        
Just to sit up under you, giving an occasional hug and kiss.<br>

Sweet dreams are non-existent without Daddy's goodnight kiss.<br>

Your gentle stroke, words just for her, your check on hers is what she'd miss.<br>

It's simply because of how you love her, I surmise.<br>

The depth of your love always shows in her eyes.<br><br>



With you, her laughter is harder and her smile is even brighter.<br>

You have a friendship, a bond, a soul tie that couldn't be any tighter.<br>

It's more than a special bond; it's an exclusive connection.<br>

No room for a third party or attempted interjection.<br>

This love is reserved just for Dad and no other.<br>

It's not the same for siblings, not even for Mother.<br>

It's the kind of love that I could never despise.<br>

For the depth of your love always shows in her eyes.<br>



To her, you'd give anything, but it's not about the gift.<br>

It's that marvelous smile brought on by the spirit you lift.<br>

It's not about what you can give her or about what you can do.<br>

It's about the unconditional love reciprocated between you two.<br>

It's the tears in her eyes when you two disagree.<br>

Nothing's quite right until 'I love you and I'm sorry.'<br>

It's that spunk in her step, the rainbow in her eye-<br>

You'll know she's a Daddy's girl when she passes by.<br>

She's got the kind of love that never fades or dies.<br>

The depth of your love always shows in her eyes.<br><br>



Upon angel wings you soar; your sparkling golden halo glows<br>

Whenever she's with you, it's Heaven in her eyes that shows.<br>

Her eyes hold a song so beautiful you'd think it was Heaven's melody.<br>

It's the music of love's symphony composed by each precious memory.<br>

The love known is the love you've shown from sunset to sunrise.<br>

The depth of your love will forever show in your daughter's eyes.<br>
