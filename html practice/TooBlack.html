<body>


  <section id="section-a">
    <p>They take my kindness for...WEAKNESS They take my silence for...SPEECHLESS ...They consider my uniqueness...STRANGE<br> 
    They call my language...SLANG They see my confidence as...CONCEIT <br>

They see my mistakes as...DEFEAT <br>

They consider my success...ACCIDENTAL <br>

They minimize my intelligence to...POTENTIAL <br>

My questions mean I am...UNAWARE <br>

My advancement is somehow...UNFAIR <br>

To voice concern is...DISCONTENTMENT 
<br>
If I stand up for myself I am too...DEFENSIVE <br>

If I don't trust them I am too...APPREHENSIVE <br>

I am defiant if I...SEPARATE <br>

I am fake if I...ASSIMILATE <br>

My Character is constantly...UNDER ATTACK <br>

Pride for my race makes me... <br>

        TOO BLACK<br>
        Lord, Lord, <br>

 

Why did You make me Black? <br>

Why did You make someone<br>

The world wants to hold back?<br>

 

Black is the color of dirty clothes;<br>

The color of grimy hands and feet.<br>

Black is the color of darkness;<br>

The color of tire-beaten streets.<br>

 

Why did You give me thick lips,<br>

A broad nose and kinky hair?<br>

Why did You make me someone<br>

Who receives the hatred stare?<br>

 

Black is the color of the bruised eye<br>

When someone gets hurt.<br>

Black is the color of darkness,<br>

Black is the color of dirt.<br>

 

How come my bone structure's so thick;<br>

My hips and cheeks are high?<br>

How come my eyes are brown<br>

And not the color of the daylight sky?<br>

 

Why do people think I'm useless?<br>

How come I feel so used?<br>

Why do some people see my skin<br>

And think I should be abused?<br>

 

Lord, I just don't understand.<br>

What is it about my skin?<br>

Why do some people want to hate me<br>

And not know the person within?<br>

 

Black is what people are "listed",<br>

When others want to keep them away.<br>

Black is the color of shadows cast.
<br>
Black is the end of the day.<br>

 

Lord, You know, my own people mistreat me<br>

And I know this just isn't right.<br>

They don't like my hair or the way I look.<br>

They say I'm too dark or too light.<br>

 

Lord, don't You think it's time<br>

For You to make a change?<br>

Why don't You re-do creation<br>

And make everyone the same?<br>
        GOD ANSWERED<br>

 

Why did I make you Black?<br>

Why did I make you Black?<br>

 

Get off your knees and look around.<br>

Tell Me, what do you see?<br>

I didn't make you in the image of darkness,<br>

I made you in the Likeness of ME!<br>
 
I made you the color of coal<br>

From which beautiful diamonds are formed.<br>

I made you the color of oil,<br>

The Black Gold that keeps people warm.<br>

 

I made you from the rich, dark earth<br>

That can grow the food you need.<br>

Your color's the same as the panther's<br>

Known for (HER) beauty and speed.<br>

 

Your color's the same as the Black stallion,<br>

A majestic animal is he.<br>

I didn't make you in the Image of darkness.<br>

I made you in likeness of ME!<br>

 

All the colors of a Heavenly Rainbow<br>

Can be found throughout every nation;<br>

And when all of those colors were blended well,<br>

YOU BECAME MY GREATEST CREATION.<br>

 

Your hair is the texture of lamb's wool.<br>

Such a humble, little creature is he.<br>

I am the Shepherd who watches them.<br>

I am the One who will watch over thee.<br>

 

You are the color of midnight sky.<br>

I put the stars' glitter in your eyes.<br>

There is a smile hidden behind your pain.<br>

That's why your cheeks are so high.<br>

 

You are the color of dark clouds formed<br>

When I send My strongest weather.<br>

I made your lips full so when you kiss<br>

The one that you love, they will remember.<br>

 

Your stature is strong; your bone structure, thick<br>

To withstand the burdens of time.<br>

The reflection you see in the mirror...<br>

The image looking back at you is MINE<br>
