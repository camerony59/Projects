    <h1>My Mother Told ME</h1>
   
    </header>

<body>
    

  <section id="section-a">
    <p>My Mother said I could be anything I want to be.<br>
  And its up to me to turn my daydreams into realities <br>
And typically,I just go with the flow as I paddle streams <br>
But now my passion burns like calories for my purpose in this thing called life<br>
What position do I play?<br>
I'm on a mission every day to decipher what kinda life <br>
I should lead. <br>
Should I lead? Should I follow. <br>
Am I filled or am I hallow? <br>
I need water cuz this life has been a tough pill to swallow. <br>
Although that begs the question, Who am I?<br>
No seriously who am I?<br>
I haven't come to a conclusion<br>
I need answers<br>
But all I have is options. <br>
And my heart is always shopping for new identities that need adopting. <br>
Cuz I've been the outcast. I've been the jock. <br>
I've been the straight shooter. I've run from cops. <br>
I feel like an actor but in this scene they took away the props<br>
I have nothing to hide behind<br>
And here I stand, exposed. <br>
Like tan lines <br>
Left with the question, who am I?<br>
3 simple words to plan my time <br>
And theyre vital <br>
My minds on stand by <br>
My soul's still idle <br>
Titles describe content <br>
And I've been a book without a cover<br>
asked my father and my mother <br>
For assistance or some other kind of help.<br>
        I'm feeling smothered. By the media.<br>
        It hovers what I want in front. <br>
Another and another and another. I've discovered. Nothing. <br>
Who am I?<br>
Everything i planed to be hasn't work out.<br> 
        InsanityWebster can't define me <br>
You are looking at a jack of all trades<br>
Wearing a mask of all shapes <br>
Ready to act with no shame<br>
It seems my possiblties are endless <br>
I could be someone to follow <br>
Or someone hardly worth a mention<br>
Like twitter <br>
I'm bitter because my friends are trend setters and dress better that me. <br>
I'm not trendy am I?<br>
But I could change<br>
And spend my change and dollar bills on fancy thangs <br>
And swallow pills<br>
Like my friends do.<br>
I don't do drugs but I love to pretend to<br>
I mean it's hard to turn down what they lend you <br>
What they send you. Weekends tend to <br>
Be a curious set of days. <br>
Friday and Saturday I do it all <br>
But by Sunday I'm ashamed of what I did<br>
I'm on the fence. And here I sit. <br>
I go to church sometimes and each time I ask God to answer the question. <br>
Who am I?<br> 
Does He know? <br>
Does he care?<br>
Are you listening. Are you there?<br>
It only makes sense to ask the Maker<br>
why he made what he made. <br>
Since we all look different our purposes can't all be the same. <br>
I am someone. <br>

An individual. Who's mostly confused and partially spiritual.<br> 

<br><br>
Looking to answer this question.<br> 
Praying the Maker will respond<br>
Hoping society will quiet down <br>
So I can listen.<br>
