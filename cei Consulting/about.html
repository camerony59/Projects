          <p>
          At Cei, we believe there is a better way to do buisness. A more valuable, less invasive way where customers are earned rather than bought. We're obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on open source technology. It's one of the least understood and least transparent aspects of technology, and we see that as an opportunity: We're excited to simplify avenues for software for everyone through our research, education, and community.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>As you know, successful social media marketing is the best way to get noticed. In our research, we discovered that primary social media strengths include: timely responding to comments, and creating clever content to engage with the current follower base.
            The current weaknesses Cei will work to improve are as follows: use of more consistent promotional campaigns, use of photo marketing/infographics, and using analytics to demonstrate effective social media marketing.
            By analyzing the current successful marketing trends, such as: use of key words, creating interesting infographics, and interacting with the audience in a fun and professional manner will be useful ways to get started.</p>
