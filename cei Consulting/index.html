        <h1>Affordable Professional Consulting</h1>
        <p>At Cei, we believe there is a better way to do buisness. A more valuable, less invasive way where customers are earned rather than bought. We're obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on open source technology. It's one of the least understood and least transparent aspects of technology, and we see that as an opportunity: We're excited to simplify avenues for software for everyone through our research, education, and community.</p>
